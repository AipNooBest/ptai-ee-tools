# Overview

PT Application Inspector is the right choice for applications of any size and industry. A unique combination of scanning methods — static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application security testing (IAST), software composition analysis (SCA), plus fingerprint and pattern matching— guarantees accurate results to defend applications everywhere from landing pages to corporate portals, online stores, banking apps, cloud services, and e-government portals.

## With PT AI, security professionals win:
* Detect and confirm security vulnerabilities without a deep dive into source code or the development process.
* Make sure that a vulnerability can be exploited before spending time to fix it. PT AI automatically generates safe test requests (exploits) to check it.
* Easily collaborate with the development team creating tickets for them with one click.
## So do your development teams:
* Start using PT AI without additional setup. No access to a test environment required.
* Detect confirmed and suspected vulnerabilities focusing on the most critical ones
* Fix code quickly. PT AI shows details and exploitation conditions for each vulnerability and automatically recommends the best place to fix to jump-start the remediation process.

# Why PT Application Inspector
## High-quality analysis
The combination of static, dynamic, and interactive application security testing (SAST + DAST + IAST) delivers unparalleled results. PT Application Inspector pinpoints only real vulnerabilities so you can focus on the problems that actually matter.
## Rapid remediation
Accurate detection, automatic vulnerability verification, filtering, incremental scanning, and an interactive data flow diagram (DFD) for each vulnerability are special features that make remediation so much quicker.
## Fix early
Minimize vulnerabilities in the final product and the costs of fixing them. Perform analysis at the earliest stages of software development.
## Flexible workflow integration
Security development lifecycle (SDL) full support. Integrates with most popular bug trackers systems, CI/CD and version control systems (Jira, Jenkins, TeamCity, and more).
## Real-time protection
Block application layer attacks with automatic export of vulnerability reports to PT Application Firewall. Your application always stays protected. PT AF blocks attacks at the firewall level — even when your team is still working to make a fix.
## Regulatory and standards compliance
PT AI helps you to regularly perform in-house compliance audit. Source code is checked for application security risks and undeclared functionality, easing compliance with key industry standards including PCI DSS.
